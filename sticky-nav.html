          The future of all sports is esports. That may sound like a bold
          statement but there is growing evidence to support it. Today’s
          spectators and participants expect to be digitally engaged while they
          watch. And the most effective way to deliver digital engagement is
          through “gamification” – the transformation of watching into playing.
          While the “real” sports world is still far bigger than the competitive
          esports community, esports is showing supporters a new kind of future.
          A future where experiences make the most of fans’ desire for
          interactivity within their leisure experiences. Today’s consumer does
          not just want to watch or listen, they also want to participate – and
          esports integrates these principles into people’s leisure time.While
          it may take some years to fully realise the impact of esports, the
          rise of mobile and virtual reality gaming combine to make a
          tantalising prospect on which to imagine its future. Consider HADO, a
          new, two versus two, sports arena-based game consisting of virtual
          reality battles. Players each wear VR headsets and strap mobile
          devices to their arms, through which they can see each others’ actions
          and fling virtual fireballs at each other – a sort of digital version
          of dodgeball. One of the reasons that HADO is so important is that it
          brings a three-dimensional experience to an esports arena, where
          otherwise they are played out on flat screens for spectators to watch.
          Sony is even working on a spectator VR system to watch esports in
          virtual reality.
